          <h1>Hello</h1>
          <p>Over the years, I have met many great people of varying professions, aspirations and ambitions, but felt no closer to discovering my own. This was until realising that I needed to stop limiting my potential options to those that I believed I was capable of at that specific point in time. The liberating realisation that I can achieve anything that I set my mind to, is what has cultivated my desire for programming. I have always thought coding and tech was neat, but attempting it never crossed my mind due to my misconception that such as thing was exclusive only to the naturally gifted computer wizards of society.</p>

          <p>Nonetheless, after doing some self learning at home through various online courses and youtube tutorials; to gauge whether or not programming is something I see myself doing in the future. I decided to fully commit by enrolling in GA’s Web Development Immersive course. As anticipated, programming has not been an easy endeavor; but surprisingly not as intimidating as my preconceptions led me to believe. GA has given me a solid foundation to be able to kick start my career as a competent developer. The most important lesson I think I’ve learned, and one I still struggle with at times, is that an Error is not a negative thing but merely a learning tool that guides you in order to become better developer.

                    <p>I created an app that retrieves concert data from the skiddle API and allows users to track all of the concerts they want to go to in London and filter them by parameters such as location and date. I intend to add a google Maps API, to allow users to see the precise location of their concert.</p>

                    <p>This app involved working directly with two of my classmates. We built a Full Stack Application that allows groups of individuals to log a trip and split the accumulated bills on that trip to determine how much money is owed to each individual and the total spend of the holiday. We used the Google Maps and Chart.js API to accomplish this goal.

                    <p>This was my first Full-stack application which involved building a fully RESTful application containing all CRUD functionalities. I built an app displaying an index of foods with their macronutrients which users can upload or find after registering and logging in.

                    <p>This was my first Front End project which involved building a JavaScript game. Since it was the holiday season, I decided to make a festive version of snakes and ladders which utilised all the fundamental concepts of JavaScript such as (but not limited to)  functions, array, loops and objects.
